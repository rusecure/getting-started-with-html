<p><b>How The Internet Works!</b></p>

The internet is a bunch of computers and systems inter-connected to share information. Typically made of clients (your computer/browser) and Server (the systems that are dedicated and optimized for delivering content to your computer). The main protocol for delivering this content of call HTTP. 
Your computer sends a request over the Internet to a server which delilver an appropriate document over HTTP. The document is typically an HTML (Hyper Text Markup Language ) document file.<br>

<p><b>HTML</b></p>

HTML is the language of the web. HTML documents serve content into browsers and web applciations.
HTML documents are made up of elements. Within elements we find tags which help format HTML documents.

<p><b>Elements and Tags</b></p>

Elements help tell browsers how to deliver tags in HTML documents. Tags help format how you see an HTML document. 
For example, things like adjusting the <font size="1">size of a font</font>, 
<b>bolding letters and words</b> or <em>italizing</em>. <br>

<p><b>"Stupid Computer!"</b></p>
An intersting topic was discussed briefly about stupid computers. 
Unfortunately, computers are only as smart as the person programming them, so it can be easy to blame a computer for misbehaving even though we may be responsible for causing the problem!<br>

<p><b>Inline vs. Block elements</b></p>

We learned about inline vs block elements. Inline elements are executed inline within the sentence you are typing basically. An examples of an inline element is &lt;br&gt;. An example of a block element would be &lt;p&gt;.<br>

<p><b>Font Size and Escaping Tags</b></p>

I also learned about some other handy tags as well in writing these courses notes on my own.
I learned about the &lt;font size&gt; tag to re-size a font. I also found how tricky simply trying to get a <em>bracket</em> displayed as simple text in a web page. 
For these, there is a concept called escaping, which allows me to tell the HTML document to display a &lt; without being interpreted. I used "&#38;lt;" for < and "&#38;gt;" for >. Also, I found "&amp" a simple "&ampamp".
I found reference to many of these escape charaters here: <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/sgml/entities.html"> Character entity references in HTML 4 </a>.
